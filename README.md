# california-house-price-linear-regression
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch without using Scikit-Learn for training. The goal is to understand the mathematical foundations of cost functions, gradient computation, and optimization using Gradient Descent.
## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch without using Scikit-Learn. 
The model is trained using Gradient Descent and evaluated using standard regression metrics.

The final model is integrated with a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to predict California house prices using Median Income as input.
## 🧠 Model Implementation

- Cost Function (MSE)
- Gradient Computation
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
