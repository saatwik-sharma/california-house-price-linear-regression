# 🏠 California House Price Prediction using Linear Regression (From Scratch)

## 📌 Introduction

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** to predict California house prices based on median income. 

The main objective of this project is to deeply understand the mathematical foundations behind Linear Regression — including cost functions, gradient computation, and optimization using Gradient Descent — **without using Scikit-Learn for training**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project:

- Linear Regression is implemented manually using NumPy.
- Model parameters (w, b) are optimized using Gradient Descent.
- The cost function (MSE) is tracked and visualized.
- Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics.
- A simple GUI is built using Tkinter to make real-time predictions.

The dataset used is the California Housing dataset.

## 🧠 Mathematical Concepts Implemented

- Hypothesis Function:  
  h(x) = w*x + b  

- Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)

- Gradient Computation:
  - ∂J/∂w
  - ∂J/∂b

- Gradient Descent Update Rule:
  w = w - α * ∂J/∂w  
  b = b - α * ∂J/∂b  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics help measure prediction accuracy and model performance.
